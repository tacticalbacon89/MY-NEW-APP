// This Project is a simple GUI  project, where i am attempting to create a single window application with as many capabilitys as i can implement succesfully. capabilitys that you would see in most well devolped applications. 
 For now the idea is a Simplified EVE Online Calculator app that will take well established data and allow the user to define his/her ships and fits and see expected results from things such as missle damage, shield reps, sustainable dps
 and the evenuality of implimenting ESI and API data to give live tracking of this data. this type of application already exsist but my intentions are to hone my skills of something simple that will still have a practical purpose.



 // this is my first c++ project and i am very new to software development but i understand the language enough (so far) to get started and try to learn as i go. if you are knowlegeable in the language and see error in my project please feel free
 critizize me and help me to understand my flaws in a educative manner and once i am confident in my project and its usefullness i will release an exe for download.
