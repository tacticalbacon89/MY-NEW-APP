// This Project is a simple GUI self teaching Learning project where i am attempting to create a single window app with as my capabilitys as i can implement succesfully that you would see in most well devolped applications 
 for now the idea is a EVE Online Calculator app that will take well established data and allow the user to define his/her ships and fits and see expected results from things such as missle damage, shield reps, sustainable dps
 and the evenuality of implimenting ESI and API data to give live tracking of this data.



 // this is my first c++ project and i am very new to software development but i understand the language enough (so far) to get started and try to learn as i go.
